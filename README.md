 for admin there's users products media product_file and orders ...



after modifying paylaod use ;;;
"This file was automatically generated by Payload.
 * DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify your source Payload config,
 * and re-run `payload generate:types` to regenerate this file.
 */"
 
 yarn payload generate:types

display contents instead of "products"

in mobile navbar in menu button selection of product and stuff seems wrong ... heading is rendered but not respective content..


#### too much later into future
for editor picks .. make seperate sort thing kinda like index..only used by admin which will pripritize to view content based on its value..


start fresh from main.. with a branch  and delete all products in db and start fres han see for yourself if it works
