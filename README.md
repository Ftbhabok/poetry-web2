stuffs and works to do on (from topmost priority to least one)






###make content filterable through author ; when author is clicked it must atake it to a page that displays all the products by that author 


### in second page make content name a bit more unique 
its just too blend to begain with 

and work on overall layought configuration of view too 

1.where content description is being viewed add somekind of a bit distinct to enhance focus on reading
maybe some kind of svg line below category 

or dynamic textbox with visual border  fr work on it
