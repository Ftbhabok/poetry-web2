stuffs and works to do on (from topmost priority to least one)



2. explore how to use editor : lexical/ slate edioor ; first see yt vds then only implement one of them 

3. Turns out product_file has too many other random added dependencies # create new one just like you did with #author (Author) maybe sth like #file (File) and try to display it below the description 



note##3
If we were able to modify and use richtext editor in our product description file area there would be no need to work on uploading  a sepaerate database file and rpduct section in a file format in pdf and txt format  sooo
